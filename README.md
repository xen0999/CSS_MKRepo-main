Hello, this is a readme for the website troubleshooting portion of the CSS section.

This Repo works in a little bit of an odd way. Each version of the site has it's own folder. Start in the Original Files folder:
When there open the ReadMe.md file and follow those instructions. 

When done with that section, open the files in the CSS_Header folder
Those files have the CSS written into the header file. 

Lastly, the External CSS Reference File folder has the last step, taking those CSS styles and putting them into an external, referenced CSS file.
