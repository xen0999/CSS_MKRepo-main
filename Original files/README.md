Hello, this is a readme for the website troubleshooting portion of the CSS section.

This will take place in three sections for each page of the website.

We are creating a webpage for our clients called FakeBook, the world's largest fake gold (pyrite) marketplace. 

They have given us different acceptance criteria (fancy tech term for requirements) which we
will need to make sure have been met. 
We will start off with the home page, some criteria may have been met.
Those criteria that haven't been met should be fixed if possible.

Home Page Acceptance Criteria
AC.1 USING CSS -  change the title font in the upper left hand corner to fantasy. 

AC.2 USING CSS - A centered picture of fake gold (pyrite) with a pixel size of 300 X 400

AC.3 USING CSS - The background color should be teal

AC.4  USING CSS - Change the background color around the main content section to silver and add a padding of 25px around all text.
                - Add a solid border to this content that is 3px and gray

AC.5 USING CSS - change the link color in the navbar to yellow - on mouseover the color should change to blue

Now these criteria are for the home page, but keep them in mind when going through the next pages to make sure
we keep the website uniform.
