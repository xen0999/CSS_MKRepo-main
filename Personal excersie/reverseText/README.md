Trying to create code that will take a scentence and put the words in reverse. For example:

Input: I went to the movies last night. 

Output: Night last movies the to went I. 

Proposal for steps that need to be taken:

1 select the text input 
2 differentiate between the words 
3 assign numbers to the words 
4 put everything in lower case
5 use numbers to re order the words.
6 put the uppercase letter at the beginning of the first word
7 add a period at the end
